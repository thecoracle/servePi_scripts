#### remarks  
\- use this script completely at your own risk  

\- needs a real or VM linux desktop system with hard disk and card reader  

\- cannot handle NOOBS images  

\- do not shrink images to minimum, otherwise they won't start on your Raspberry, especially Raspbian Full *Desktop* images need some extra space, about >= 250 MB are advised, Raspbian *Lite* images might be more moderate  

\- when starting from a shrinked SD card for the first time, expand the filesystem to fill its space  

by raspi-config  
`sudo raspi-config` -> *Expand Filesystem*  
`sudo reboot`  
  
**or** from command line  
`sudo raspi-config --expand-rootfs`  
`sudo reboot`  

\- the script is 'half automatic', meaning at one point it will start GParted on desktop and guide you what to do  

\- the script was developed and tested on a VirtualBox Windows host with Linux Mint guest  

\- inspired by
