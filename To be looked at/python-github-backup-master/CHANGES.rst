-------------------

- Add additional output for the current request. [Robin Gloster]

- Add option to backup additional PR details. [Robin Gloster]

  Some payload is only included when requesting a single pull request


- Mark string as binary in comparison for skip_existing. [Johannes
  Bornhold]

  Found out that the flag "--skip-existing" did not work out as expected on Python

  in Python3.

0.13.0 (2017-04-05)
-------------------

- Add OS check for OSX specific keychain args. [Martin O'Reilly]

  Keychain arguments are only supported on Mac OSX.
  Added check for operating system so we give a
  "Keychain arguments are only supported on Mac OSX"
  error message rather than a "No password item matching the
  provided name and account could be found in the osx keychain"
  error message


- Add support for storing PAT in OSX keychain. [Martin O'Reilly]

  Added additional optional arguments and README guidance for storing
  and accessing a Github personal access token (PAT) in the OSX
  keychain


0.12.1 (2017-03-27)
-------------------

- Avoid remote branch name churn. [Chris Adams]

  This avoids the backup output having lots of "[new branch]" messages
  because removing the old remote name removed all of the existing branch
  references.


- Fix detection of bare git directories. [Andrzej Maczuga]

0.12.0 (2016-11-22)
-------------------

Fix
~~~

Other
~~~~~

- Pep8: E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent. [Jose
  Diaz-Gonzalez]

- Support archivization using bare git clones. [Andrzej Maczuga]

- Fix typo, 3x. [Terrell Russell]

0.11.0 (2016-10-26)
-------------------

- Support --token file:///home/user/token.txt (fixes gh-51) [Björn
  Dahlgren]

- Fix some linting. [Albert Wang]

- Fix byte/string conversion for python 3. [Albert Wang]

- Support python 3. [Albert Wang]

- Encode special characters in password. [Remi Rampin]

- Don't pretend program name is "Github Backup" [Remi Rampin]

- Don't install over insecure connection. [Remi Rampin]

  The git:// protocol is unauthenticated and unencrypted, and no longer advertised by GitHub. Using HTTPS shouldn't impact performance.

0.10.3 (2016-08-21)
-------------------

- Fixes #29. [Jonas Michel]

  Reporting an error when the user's rate limit is exceeded causes
  the script to terminate after resuming execution from a rate limit
  sleep. Instead of generating an explicit error we just want to
  inform the user that the script is going to sleep until their rate
  limit count resets.


- Fixes #29. [Jonas Michel]

  The errors list was not being cleared out after resuming a backup
  from a rate limit sleep. When the backup was resumed, the non-empty
  errors list caused the backup to quit after the next `retrieve_data`
  request.


0.10.2 (2016-08-21)
-------------------

- Add a note regarding git version requirement. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  Closes #37

0.10.0 (2016-08-18)
-------------------

- Implement incremental updates. [Robert Bradshaw]

  Guarded with an --incremental flag.

  Stores the time of the last update and only downloads issue and
  pull request data since this time.  All other data is relatively
  small (likely fetched with a single request) and so is simply
  re-populated from scratch as before.


0.9.0 (2016-03-29)
------------------

- Fix cloning private repos with basic auth or token. [Kazuki Suda]

0.8.0 (2016-02-14)
------------------

- Don't store issues which are actually pull requests. [Enrico Tröger]

  This prevents storing pull requests twice since the Github API returns
  pull requests also as issues. Those issues will be skipped but only if
  retrieving pull requests is requested as well.
  Closes #23.


0.7.0 (2016-02-02)
------------------

- Softly fail if not able to read hooks. [Albert Wang]

- Add note about 2-factor auth. [Albert Wang]

- Make user repository search go through endpoint capable of reading
  private repositories. [Albert Wang]

- Prompt for password if only username given. [Alex Hall]

0.6.0 (2015-11-10)
------------------

- Force proper remote url. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

- Improve error handling in case of HTTP errors. [Enrico Tröger]

  In case of a HTTP status code 404, the returned 'r' was never assigned.
  In case of URL errors which are not timeouts, we probably should bail
  out.


- Add --hooks to also include web hooks into the backup. [Enrico Tröger]

- Create the user specified output directory if it does not exist.
  [Enrico Tröger]

  Fixes #17.


- Add missing auth argument to _get_response() [Enrico Tröger]

  When running unauthenticated and Github starts rate-limiting the client,
  github-backup crashes because the used auth variable in _get_response()
  was not available. This change should fix it.


- Add repository URL to error message for non-existing repositories.
  [Enrico Tröger]

  This makes it easier for the user to identify which repository does not
  exist or is not initialised, i.e. whether it is the main repository or
  the wiki repository and which clone URL was used to check.


0.5.0 (2015-10-10)
------------------

- Add release script. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

- Refactor to both simplify codepath as well as follow PEP8 standards.
  [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

- Retry 3 times when the connection times out. [Mathijs Jonker]

- Made unicode output defalut. [Kirill Grushetsky]

- Import alphabetised. [Kirill Grushetsky]

- Preserve Unicode characters in the output file. [Kirill Grushetsky]

  Added option to preserve Unicode characters in the output file

- Josegonzales/python-github-backup#12 Added backup of labels and
  milestones. [aensley]

- Fixed indent. [Mathijs Jonker]

- Skip unitialized repo's. [mjonker-embed]

  These gave me errors which caused mails from crontab.

- Added prefer-ssh. [mjonker-embed]

  Was needed for my back-up setup, code includes this but readme wasn't updated

- Retry API requests which failed due to rate-limiting. [Chris Adams]

  This allows operation to continue, albeit at a slower pace,
  if you have enough data to trigger the API rate limits

- Logging_subprocess: always log when a command fails. [Chris Adams]

  Previously git clones could fail without any indication
  unless you edited the source to change `logger=None` to use
  a configured logger.

  Now a non-zero return code will always output a message to
  stderr and will display the executed command so it can be
  rerun for troubleshooting.


- Switch to using ssh_url. [Chris Adams]

  The previous commit used the wrong URL for a private repo. This was
  masked by the lack of error loging in logging_subprocess (which will be
  in a separate branch)


- Add an option to prefer checkouts over SSH. [Chris Adams]

  This is really useful with private repos to avoid being nagged
  for credentials for every repository


- Add pull request support. [Kevin Laude]

  Back up reporitory pull requests by passing the --include-pulls
  argument. Pull requests are saved to
  repositories/<repository name>/pulls/<pull request number>.json. Include
  the --pull-request-comments argument to add review comments to the pull
  request backup and pass the --pull-request-commits argument to add
  commits to the pull request backup.

  Pull requests are automatically backed up when the --all argument is
  uesd.


- Add GitHub Enterprise support. [Kevin Laude]

  Pass the -H or --github-host argument with a GitHub Enterprise hostname
  to backup from that GitHub enterprise host. If no argument is passed
  then back up from github.com.

  Gonzalez]
