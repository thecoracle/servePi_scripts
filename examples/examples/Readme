Examples from "Learning the bash Shell", second edition.
--------------------------------------------------------

Archive Version: 2.0

This archive contains nearly all the examples from the book. I
say "nearly all" because I didn't bother including the simple
one or two line examples, or any examples which were just
psuedo-code.

Just about all of the examples will work with bash versions 1.14 and
later. There is very little that will only run under bash 2.0.
If you have the earlier version of bash, you won't be able to run
the debugger. Update to 2.0.

I've also included some bonus shell stuff and a partial solution
to one of the exercises.

The examples assume that you have bash as your standard shell. If not,
put a  #!/bin/bash  (or whatever you bash path is) at the top of each
one.

These examples should work. I wrote nearly all of them, tested
them, and then copy/pasted into the electronic manuscript of LtbS.
To create this archive, I went through the manuscript and copy/pasted
out to new files (removing formatting characters in the process) to
make sure what is in the archive corresponds with the book. I didn't
test all of the new versions - so there is a tiny chance that some
don't work (probably because of formatting characters that I didn't
remove - the examples as printed in the book should work. I hate it
when I use a technical book and the examples don't work, so you can
rest assured I have double checked mine :) ).

If you find any that don't work, for any reason, please send email
to O'Reilly's (bookquestions@ora.com) or to me (cam@iinet.com.au).
Please send problems with the *book* to bookquestions@ora.com.

I hope you find the book and examples useful!
